            <h2>Hi, my name is Derek and Iâ€™m a front end developer.</h2>
            <p>
               My passion for programming and technology goes back nearly a
               decade.

            <p>
               First, falling in love with computers, after building one in
               middle school, and later programming, after taking an
               introduction course in high school. I enrolled at CSULB as a
               Computer Science major for 2 years, after which prompted me to
               complete a front end developmer bootcamp with Udacity.

               Recently teaching myself ReactJS, I enjoy spending my free time
               honing and expanding my skill set.
