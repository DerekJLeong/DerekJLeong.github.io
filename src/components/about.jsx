            <p>
               My passion for programming and technology goes back nearly a
               decade.

            <p>
               First, falling in love with computers, after building one in
               middle school, and later programming, after taking an
               introduction course in high school.
            </p>
            <p>
               I enrolled at CSULB as a Computer Science major for 2 years. My
               desire for more prompted me to leave and complete Udacity's Front
               End Developer Nanodegree program. As it is one of my passions, I
               frequenty spend my free time becoming a better developer.
