               My passion for programming and technology goes back nearly a
               decade.

               First, falling in love with computers, after building one in
               middle school,
               <br />
               and later programming, after taking an introduction course in
               high school.
               <br />
               I attended CSULB for Computer Science for 2 years, after which
               prompted me
               <br />
               to complete a front end development coding bootcamp with Udacity.
            </p>
            <p>
               Recently teaching myself ReactJS, I enjoy spending my free time
               honing and expanding my craft.
