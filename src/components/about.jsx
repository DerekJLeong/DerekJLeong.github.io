            <p>
               My passion for programming and technology goes back nearly a
               decade.
            </p>
            <p>
               First, falling in love with computers, after building one in
               middle school, and later programming, after taking an
               introduction course in high school. I enrolled at CSULB as a
               Computer Science major for 2 years. My desire for more prompted
               me to complete Udacity's Front End Developer Nanodegree program.
               As it is one of my passions, I frequenty spend my free time
               becoming a better developer.
